__How it works__

This app allows you to download objects from a web page. To download from a web page you have to type the url into the app. Afterwards, press the "GO" button and the app goes and fetch all the links from the web page. The app then presents a list of all the links. When a link gets click on, the app starts a download for the object at the clicked link.
